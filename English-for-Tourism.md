Diamond Bay Resort Nha Trang, strategically along Nguyen Tat Thanh Boulevard, situating on the scenic southern outskirts of the city, the resort encompasses a sprawling area featuring private beach access, a championship golf course, extensive MICE accommodation, is a prominent integrated resort in Khanh Hoa Province. Boasting a prime beachfront location and a wealth of amenities, Diamond Bay has become a significant draw for both domestic and international tourists. Its self-contained nature and comprehensive offerings position it as a unique microcosm within Nha Trang's broader tourism landscape. This report specifically focuses on Diamond Bay to examine how a large-scale integrated resort operates, its direct and indirect influence on the surrounding environment and community, and the potential pathways for its continued development in harmony with sustainable tourism principles. By analyzing its current operational model, investment potential, and holistic impacts, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of sustainable tourism in the region.

4.1. The Current Situation Regarding Tourism Activities at the Site (Topic Point 1)
(Completed by: Hoang Ngan)
Diamond Bay Resort & Spa Nha Trang stands out as one of the most established and prestigious resorts in the region, offering guests a harmonious blend of natural beauty and high-standard services. Ideally located along a private stretch of coastline, the resort boasts powdery white sands, crystal-clear waters, and breathtaking panoramic sea views—providing a serene, secluded atmosphere that is still within convenient reach of the city center. Its expansive grounds are shaded by lush, well-maintained greenery, creating a fresh and tranquil environment perfect for rest and rejuvenation.
Guest accommodations are fully equipped, clean, and comfortable, with several rooms offering private balconies and direct sea views—suitable for families, couples, and business travelers alike. The large outdoor swimming pool is well-kept and accompanied by various recreational options such as kayaking, cycling, and open-air movie screenings, enriching the overall guest experience. On-site restaurants serve delicious, reasonably priced meals, while the staff is consistently praised for their professionalism, warmth, and attentive customer care. In addition, electric shuttles operate throughout the resort, providing guests with convenient access to all facilities.
Nevertheless, the resort’s location—approximately 10 to 15 minutes by car from the city center—may pose some limitations for guests interested in exploring local attractions and nightlife. Additionally, room rates and service charges tend to be higher than those of standard hotels, reflecting its upscale positioning.
In summary, Diamond Bay Resort & Spa remains an excellent choice for travelers seeking a luxurious, peaceful retreat close to nature. With its picturesque setting, comprehensive amenities, and dedicated service, it continues to uphold its reputation as one of Nha Trang’s premier resort destinations.
4.2. What the Provincial Government Can Do to Encourage Investors (Topic Point 2)
(Completed by: Anh Le)
From my field trip and observations at Diamond Bay Resort & Spa, I realized that this area has considerable potential for developing resort tourism and ancillary services. However, to attract investment effectively, the Khanh Hoa provincial government needs to have practical solutions that are suitable to local characteristics.
Firstly, it is necessary to upgrade the traffic infrastructure and add public signs in the area leading to the resort. Although it is not far from the city center, traveling to Diamond Bay is still difficult for many individual guests due to the lack of clear signs and multilingual information systems. Mr. Huu - a bellman at the resort - shared: "Foreign guests riding motorbikes often have to ask for directions because they cannot see the resort's name clearly." Adding signs, public lighting, and bus stops not only improves the visitor experience but also demonstrates professionalism, contributing to creating trust for investors.
Secondly, the government should provide indirect support through preferential policies such as reducing tourism land taxes, supporting loans, or calling for investment in the form of public-private partnerships (PPP). The facilities at Diamond Bay, after nearly twenty years of operation, have begun to deteriorate. Mr. Minh - a technical staff - commented: "Many rooms look luxurious from the outside, but the interior is outdated." If there is a reasonable renovation support mechanism, businesses will have more motivation to upgrade the resort and invest in the long term.
Finally, the government can coordinate with businesses to organize annual cultural and entertainment events to increase tourism attraction. For example, organize a night market to sell specialties and souvenirs, and build an outdoor lounge with light music and cocktails by the sea - meeting the night entertainment needs of tourists. As Mr. Tuan - a receptionist - said: "International guests often ask about night activities or festivals, but this area is mainly for relaxation."
In short, although not directly operating private resorts, local governments still play a fundamental role in facilitating investment, planning infrastructure, and developing activities to support sustainable tourism.
4.3. The Positive and Negative Effects of Tourism at the Site (Topic Point 3)
(Completed by: Tung Linh)
Diamond Bay Resort and Spa is a well-established resort with nearly 20 years in business. It's owned by Hoan Cau Diamond Bay Resort Joint Stock Company, a company known for investing in numerous quality facilities throughout Nha Trang. This background instills confidence in the high standard of service guests can expect at Diamond Bay Resort and Spa. Beside the advantages from the influential support from owner company, we still need to address some disadvantages.
Diamond Bay Resort and Spa boasts a truly unique location that beautifully highlights its distinguishing features. Guests are enveloped by lush tropical greenery, gentle hills, and the calming sounds of the ocean, allowing them to immerse themselves completely in nature. The resort's aim is to offer a natural escape without the need to travel far, a goal it has successfully achieved, becoming one of Nha Trang's most renowned places to stay. Beyond its stunning natural surroundings, another unique aspect is its bungalow accommodation. This is a rare find in a city like Nha Trang, where buildings typically dominate the landscape. Furthermore, the resort's wide range of facilities and activities provides guests with a variety of experiences. Depending on their interests, guests can choose to swim in the pool or at the beach, go kayaking, or enjoy cycling.
While there are clear advantages, some disadvantages need to be addressed, with the expectation of changes in the near future. One immediate concern is the deterioration of facilities, especially the accommodation. Although the resort's predominantly wooden bungalows were designed to offer a luxurious and exclusive experience, their current state of deterioration makes them feel less luxurious and more antiquated. Despite the natural occurrence of beach wrack due to the tide range, the resort consistently fails to clean it regularly. Additionally, having operated for almost 20 years, the interior design throughout the resort has become outdated and doesn't appeal to today's youth. If the resort aims to attract more guests from this demographic, a significant renovation and modernization will need to be seriously considered.
Diamond Bay Resort and Spa, a long-established Nha Trang resort, offers a unique natural setting with bungalows and diverse activities. Yet, its aging facilities and outdated interiors need renovation to attract younger guests and maintain its luxury appeal.
5. Conclusion
(Completed by: Kim Ngoc)
The field trip to Diamond Bay Resort provided us with valuable insights into how tourism services operate in a high-end resort environment. Through direct observation and group discussions, we learned that quality customer service, clean facilities, and a relaxing atmosphere are key to guest satisfaction. However, ensuring sustainable growth requires effective management of negative impacts and responsible investment. Only through such a balanced and forward-thinking approach can Diamond Bay Resort continually maximize its inherent potential, delivering long-term benefits to visitors, the local community and the pristine environment, thereby reinforcing its important contribution to the attractiveness of Nha Trang. This experience highlighted the importance of practical knowledge in tourism education and showed us how tourism can positively contribute to local development when well managed.
